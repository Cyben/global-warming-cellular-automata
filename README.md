# 🌍 Global Warming Cellular Automata

A dynamic simulation of global warming using **cellular automata**, featuring **rain**, **clouds**, **wind**, and **biomes**. This project brings climate processes to life through computational modeling, helping visualize how different environmental factors interact and evolve over time.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This simulation models Earth's climate using a grid of cells, each representing a piece of land or atmosphere. Through custom rules, it simulates how temperature, weather, and biome conditions shift over time due to natural patterns and human influence.

Each frame in the simulation reflects interactions between:
- 🔥 **Heat propagation**
- 🌧️ **Rain systems**
- ☁️ **Cloud formation and movement**
- 🌬️ **Wind patterns**
- 🏞️ **Biomes** (like forests, city, sea)

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.X
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`
