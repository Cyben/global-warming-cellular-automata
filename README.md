# global-warming-cellular-automata
This is a broadcast made by a cellular automata to show the global warming.

To run this code you should use Python 3.8+ and install all the relevant packages, you can use the attached requirements.txt file for that.
After installing everything run the main.py file which is the main file in the application.
Now a GUI of the simulation should show up and the simulation should run.

The simulation starts in a fullscreen, to disable that, click on F11 of escape.
